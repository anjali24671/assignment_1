    "    Ans) An API stands for Application programmable interface. It is an intermediatery between two or more applications, allowing them to communicate effectively without the need to understand each others internal code. It helps developers to build new applications on top of already build application services, without the need to concern over the internal conversion of format( programming language). \n",
